# Owkin Algorithm

## Summary
The algorithm ensembles an approach that uses 3 U-Nets and 45 engineered features (1) and a 3D VGG derivative (2).
The cancer probability is predicted by both approaches using XGBoost and in the end ensembled using the average.

## Algorithm design
Approach 1 uses 3 U-Nets which are structured as follows:  
![U-Net X](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6676439/30765249-08a9966c-9fef-11e7-9c2f-2718ad3aea0f.png)  

Approach 2 in turn uses a 3D VGG derivative that predicts 11 output variables:

### Preprocessing
Approach 1 normalizes the Hounsfield values and then uses k-means clustering with k=2.  
Approach 2 segments the lung using Hounsfield units and fills the lung structures that is according to the author superior to morphological closing.

### Nodule detection
Approach 1 applies `a U-Net to each slice in direction X, Y or Z to output a mask with the same shape where the 1s represent the nodules detected by the Unet`.
A custom loss functions has been used to train the U-Nets (the Dice coefficient).
It `appl[ies] these U-Net on all the slices to obtain 6 different 3D binary segmentation masks of the detected nodules (directions X, Y, Z + unions I1, I2 and I3)`  
Approach 2 passes 64x64x64 cubes of the patient's scan to the 3D VGG model, which predicts 11 features in turn.

### Prediction of cancer probability
Approach 1 `extract[s] the 10 biggest nodules and compute[s] 45 features for each nodule (including location, area, volume, HU statistics etc.).`
These 450 features are then passed to a XGBoost classifier whereupon the 6 predictions are then averaged.  
Approach 2 passes the predicted features to a XGBoost classifier as well.

## Use cases


### When to use this algorithm

 - if you want to use other lung segmentation methods than Hounsfield Unit clipping since the presented approaches also use morphologic features, filling and clustering

### When to avoid this algorithm

 - if a GPU us not available or the memory is very limited (8 million parameters per U-Net)

## Adaptation into Concept To Clinic
Since I was lacking the training data and CUDA, I was not able to completely run the scripts.

### Porting to Python 3.5+
Porting it to Python 3.5 should be as easy as running `2to3`.
After adapting `print` statements to Python 3, I was able to start all scripts without import errors, deprecation warnings or the like.

### Porting to run on CPU and GPU
Loading the models was easily possible using Tensorflow CPU.
However, I can't make a statement about how long it takes to make predictions using the CPU only.

### Improvements on the code base
I like the code base so far.

### Adapting the model
We should examine the approaches to segment lungs carefully that were used by the presented approaches.
Also, we definitely should have a look at [pyradiomics](https://github.com/Radiomics/pyradiomics) as this allowed one author to easily compute 45 features by just passing the image mask of a nodule and letting pyradiomics do the work.

## Comments
I really like the code base.
It is relatively clean and well documented for a competition submission.
My only concerns are regarding how long it would take to predict nodules of a patient using a CPU only.
One U-Net alone has 8 million parameters and the VGG derivative 400k.
Approach 1 alone apparently took 2-3 minutes for one patient to predict his cancer probability, which certainly involved at least one GPU.
